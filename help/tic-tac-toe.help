DESCRIPTION:
------------
Tic Tac Toe – Batch Game is a console-based implementation of the
classic X/O board game. The program supports two languages (EN/PL),
renders the board dynamically, validates moves, detects wins or draws,
and allows players to restart the game without closing the program.

The game is designed for two local players (X and O).

FEATURES:
--------
• Dual-language start menu (English / Polish)
• Dynamic 3×3 board display
• Move validation (occupied cells, range 1–9)
• Automatic win detection
• Draw detection
• Option to play again after the match
• ANSI-colored messages for clarity

CONTROLS:
---------
Players enter a number from 1 to 9 to place their symbol.

Board layout:

   1 | 2 | 3
  ---+---+---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---+---+---
   7 | 8 | 9

Rules:
• X always starts
• Players alternate turns
• A move is rejected if the cell is already taken or invalid

WIN CONDITIONS:
---------------
The program checks all possible winning lines:

• 3 rows  
• 3 columns  
• 2 diagonals  

If three matching symbols (X or O) align, the game ends with a winner.

DRAW:
-----
If all cells are filled and no winner is found, the game ends in a draw.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
• Windows 7 / 10 / 11  
• Standard CMD environment  
• ANSI support (Windows 10+)  

USAGE:
------
Run:

  tic_tac_toe.cmd

On startup:
  • Choose language (1 – English, 2 – Polski)
  • The game begins immediately
  • Enter cell numbers to make moves

After the match:
  • The program asks if you want to play again
  • Valid responses:
      EN → Y / N
      PL → T / N

NOTES:
------
• The game does not include AI (no single-player mode)
• The board resets automatically when starting a new match
• Invalid inputs are rejected with a message

END:
----
After declining a rematch, the program displays a farewell message
based on the selected language.
