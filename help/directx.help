DESCRIPTION:
------------
The DirectX End‑User Runtime Web Installer is a Microsoft tool used to
download and install legacy DirectX components required by older games
and multimedia applications. It supplements Windows with optional
runtime libraries such as D3DX9, D3DX10, D3DX11, XAudio 2.7, XInput 1.3,
and other components originally included in the DirectX SDK.

This installer does NOT upgrade DirectX 11/12 and does not change the
DirectX version shown in dxdiag.

FEATURES:
--------
• Downloads only the DirectX components missing on the system  
• Installs legacy libraries required by older games  
• Very small installer size (~288 KB)  
• Fully automatic installation process  
• Compatible with Windows XP → Windows 11  

OPERATION DETAILS:
------------------
• Downloads required components directly from Microsoft servers
